									The Public Procurement and Disposal Act, 2015 (the PPDA, 2015)

									of Parliament that seeks to give effect to Article 227 of the
									Constitution which requires that an Act of Parliament be
									enacted to prescribe a framework within which policies
									relating to procurement and asset disposal in respect of a
									State organ or any other public entity shall be implemented.
									The PPDA, 2015 repealed the Public Procurement and Disposal
									Act, 2005 (the PPDA 2005)

								<p style={{ fontSize: "1.33em" }}>
									The PPDA, 2015 applies to all State organs and public entities
									with respect to procurement planning, procurement processing,
									inventory and asset management, disposal of assets and
									contract management. The PPDA, 2015 goes on to list the
									entities that would fall under the definition of a “public
									entity” including but not limited to the national and county
									governments (including any of their organs or departments),
									the Central Bank of Kenya, state corporations and companies
